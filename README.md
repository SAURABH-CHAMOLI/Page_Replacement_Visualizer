# Page Replacement Algorithm Visualizer 🧠💻

This project provides an **educational, web-based visualization tool** for page replacement algorithms used in operating systems. It allows users to input custom page reference strings and observe real-time simulations of how different algorithms manage memory.

## 🎯 Purpose

Understanding how operating systems handle page replacement can be challenging. This tool offers **interactive visual feedback** and **live metrics** to improve conceptual clarity and learning efficiency.
